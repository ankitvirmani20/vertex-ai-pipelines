Vertex AI Pipelines
Fully Managed Service: Vertex AI Pipelines is a core component of Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform. It is a managed service specifically designed for building and deploying machine learning pipelines.
Focus and Integration: Vertex AI Pipelines focuses on streamlining ML workflows and integrates seamlessly with other components of Vertex AI such as Vertex AI Training and Vertex AI Model Registry.
Underlying Technology: Built on top of Kubernetes and Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP), leveraging the capabilities of these technologies while providing a simplified user experience.

Vertex AI Pipelines: Best if you want a streamlined, managed experience for building ML pipelines fully within the Google Cloud ecosystem.
Kubeflow Pipelines: Choose this if you prioritize open-source, maximum flexibility, Kubernetes expertise, and a wider variety of use cases beyond just ML.
MLflow: Ideal when your main need is experiment tracking, model comparison, and model deployment rather than full pipeline orchestration.
Airflow: Opt for Airflow when you need a powerful general-purpose workflow orchestrator that can handle a broad range of tasks, including but not limited to ML pipelines.

MLflow isn't a true end-to-end pipeline orchestrator:
MLflow's Core Focus: MLflow primarily excels in these areas:
Experiment Tracking: Keeping detailed records of model runs, parameters, metrics, and artifacts.
Model Packaging: Bundling models in a standard format for deployment across different environments.
Model Registry: A central repository for versioning and managing models throughout their lifecycle.
Orchestration vs. Model Lifecycle Focus: While MLflow allows you to log and package individual steps of a machine learning workflow, it doesn't provide the following, which are key to end-to-end pipeline orchestration:
Workflow Definition: MLflow lacks a built-in way to define a complete pipeline as a sequence of connected steps with dependencies.
Dependency Management: It doesn't manage how steps should be triggered based on results from other steps.
Scheduling and Execution: MLflow won't execute the pipeline at scheduled intervals or based on specific events.
How to Use MLflow With Pipelines
MLflow is best integrated into a full-fledged pipeline tool for the orchestration part:
Within Each Step: Use MLflow to track, package, and manage models within individual components of your pipeline.
Orchestration Tools: Use tools like Kubeflow Pipelines, Airflow, or even custom scripts to define the overall structure of your pipeline, dependencies between steps, and schedule execution.
